It includes discussion relevant to reducing memory issues when training such models and demonstrates how to change the decoding strategy after training. Finally, it also provides a brief glimpse of extracting alignment information from a trained Transducer model.\n",

Many concepts such as data loader setup, optimization setup, pre-trained checkpoint weight loading will be nearly identical between CTC and Transducer models.\n",

        "We covered significant ground in this tutorial, but here are a few key takeaways -\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Any CTC config can be easily converted to a Transducer config** by copy-pasting the default Transducer config components.\n",
        "\n",
        "-------\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Dataset processing for CTC and Transducer models are the same!** If it works for CTC it works exactly the same way for Transducers. This also applies to Character-based models vs. Sub-word tokenization-based models.\n",
        "\n",
        "-------\n",
        "\n",
        "3) **Fused Batch during training and evaluation significantly reduces the need for large GPU memory**, and we can simply reduce the `fused_batch_size` to process samples at a larger acoustic (global) batch size (the maximum batch size that can be passed through the acoustic model, disregarding the Prediction and Joint models).\n",
        "\n",
        "-------\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Once trained, **transducer models implicitly can be used for beam search**! The prediction network acts as an implicit language model and can easily be used for this beam search by switching the decoding configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "-------\n",
        "\n",
        "5) **Alignments can be easily extracted from Transducers** by adding a special flag to the Decoding setup. After this, it is quite simple to extract the 2-d alignment grid of the transducer for samples or a batch of samples. It must be noted that this alignment information does require slightly more memory, and increases decoding time by a small amount as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "-------\n",
        "\n",
        "This is just the start of our journey into Transducers. There are several improvements coming out every few months for these models, and we encourage contributions to improve the transducer framework in NeMo!"
